    <h1>Dates Mentioned in <em>Book Beat</em> Broadcasts</h1>
    <p>This table of centuries, decades and years intends to show every date mentioned in the <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/library/collections/digital-archives/don-swaim">Don Swaim Collection</a>'s <em>Book Beat</em> broadcast transcripts. It was generated from data mined by Python Natural Language Processing library <a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a>, which uses a machine learning model trained on the <a href="https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T19">OntoNotes</a> corpus of news and conversations to tag named entities, including dates. It does not get everything right-- especially at the beginning and end of the table-- but it does offer a detailed cross-section of the temporal world of <em>Book Beat</em></p>
